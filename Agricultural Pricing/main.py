PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The government of a country wants to decide what prices should be charged for its dairy products: milk, butter, and cheese
. All these products are produced (directly or indirectly) from the countryâ€™s raw milk production operations. This raw milk
production is divided into two main components: fat and dry matter. After subtracting the quantities of fat and dry matter,
which are used for making products for export or consumption on the farms, there is a total yearly availability of 600,000 tons of 
fat and 750,000 tons of dry matter. This is all available for producing milk, butter and two kinds of cheese for domestic 
consumption"""
